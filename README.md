<h3>Hello! I'm Kristy Williams </h3> 

I am a passionate and dedicated data scientist transitioning from a successful career in the music industry. With over 15 years of experience running an independent record label and working with streaming online retail stores, I bring a unique blend of creative and analytical skills to the field of data science. My journey into data science began during my tenure at Retail Marketing Solutions, where I worked extensively with large databases and used SQL to manipulate and update data. This experience laid the foundation for my analytical skills and sparked my interest in the transformative power of data. Throughout my career in the music industry, I've consistently been drawn to how data can inform and revolutionize business strategies. Witnessing the use of AI in predicting music trends and optimizing data within the industry has been particularly fascinating. This fascination led me to pursue formal training in data science, equipping me with the technical skills and knowledge necessary for this career transition.
